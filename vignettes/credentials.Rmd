# **Where can I get my credentials?**

If you are wondering where you can get your API token or you are not sure about
the url, name of the upstream project, the ixplorer repository name or the 
user name, this vignette will show how to get them.

## Getting the API token
The first thing you should do is to go to the **settings** option that it's 
below your account avatar.

Once there, there is a tab with the **applications** name on it. Click there 
and you will hace the option to generate an API token. You have to put a name
to your token and then create it.
